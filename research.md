Several JavaScript-based alternatives to Manim can run entirely in the browser without requiring a server, including offline operation via WebAssembly (WASM) or pure JavaScript implementations. These tools support mathematical animations, interactivity, and client-side rendering.

### MathLikeAnim-rs
This Rust-based library compiles to WebAssembly and runs directly in the browser, enabling full offline functionality without server dependency. It supports interactive mathematical animations with features like basic shapes, function plotting, LaTeX rendering, and 2D/3D rendering. The library uses `@mathlikeanim-rs/mathlikeanim-rs` and `@mathlikeanim-rs/renderer` packages from NPM and initializes via a module script in HTML, making it suitable for standalone deployment.[1]

### Manim Web Transcrypt
A web adaptation of Manim that uses Transcrypt to convert Python code into JavaScript, allowing Manim-like animations to be executed in-browser. Although many underlying libraries must be reimplemented in JavaScript, it enables real-time interaction and playback using only a browser. This approach supports offline use if all dependencies are bundled locally.[2][3]

### Manim Web (Pyodide-based)
A variant of ManimCE that leverages Pyodide to run Python in the browser via WebAssembly. It supports asynchronous animations and integrates MathJax for LaTeX rendering, eliminating the need for system-level LaTeX. While still under development, it allows mathematical animations to be created and viewed entirely client-side, with no server required after initial loading.[4]

### math.js
While not an animation library itself, math.js is a comprehensive JavaScript math library that supports symbolic computation, matrix operations, and unit conversions. It can be combined with canvas or SVG-based rendering libraries (e.g., Three.js or AnimeJS) to build custom mathematical animations that run offline in-browser. Its compatibility with any JavaScript engine makes it ideal for standalone applications.[5]

These tools collectively provide viable, server-free, offline-capable alternatives to Manim in JavaScript or WebAssembly environments, supporting both interactivity and mathematical rigor.
